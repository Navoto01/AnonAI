### **How It Works**

AnonAI is powered by the **Flutter** framework, which allows it to run smoothly on multiple platforms.

The core of the app is a conversation interface where your messages are sent to an advanced AI engine. This engine processes your request and generates a response. To give the AI a unique and consistent personality, it follows a specific set of instructions and a background story established by its creators at **AnonLab**, with lead developer **Navoto01**.

All your customization settings‚Äîfrom dark mode to font size‚Äîare saved directly on your device, ensuring that your preferences are remembered every time you open the app. This local storage, combined with a robust user account system, allows your experience to be consistent across devices.

### **Customization Options**

You can personalize your AnonAI experience in several ways:

* **Appearance:** Easily switch between a **dark mode** for comfortable low-light use and a light theme for a bright, clean look.
* **Font Size:** Adjust the text size of the AI's responses to improve readability.
* **Animations and Sound:** Toggle smooth **animations** and interactive **sound effects** on or off to create the perfect user environment for you.
* **Language:** Select your preferred language from the list of supported options to enjoy a fully localized experience.
